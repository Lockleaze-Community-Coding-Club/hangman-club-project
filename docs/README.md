Welcome to the **Hangman** game project! This beginner-friendly Python game is designed for learning, collaboration, and fun.
This project will use a virtual development environment contained within a Virtual Machine for local development which then shall be pushed into git hub, which in turn shall switch on github actions to create a CI/CD pipeline. See the below document for a description of this;

## 📘 Development Environment Description:

- [Development Environment Description](</docs/dev_env_git_actions_guide.md>)

## 🚀 What is Hangman?

Hangman is a word guessing game where the player tries to uncover a secret word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess brings the stick figure closer to hanging!
